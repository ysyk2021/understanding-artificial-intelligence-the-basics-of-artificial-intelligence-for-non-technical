Chapter 2: What is Artificial Intelligence?
===========================================

Definition of Artificial Intelligence
-------------------------------------

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech or images, making decisions, and solving problems. AI is a broad field that includes different technologies, such as machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics.

AI systems are designed to be adaptive and can learn from data inputs, allowing them to improve their performance over time. They can also be programmed to make decisions based on specific criteria, making them useful for a wide range of applications, from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnoses.

Types of Artificial Intelligence
--------------------------------

There are three main types of artificial intelligence:

### 1. Narrow or Weak AI

Narrow or weak AI refers to systems that are designed to perform specific tasks, such as playing chess or detecting fraud. These systems are limited in their scope and cannot perform tasks outside of their programmed capabilities.

### 2. General or Strong AI

General or strong AI refers to systems that can perform any intellectual task that a human can do. This type of AI is still largely theoretical and has not yet been achieved.

### 3. Artificial Superintelligence

Artificial superintelligence refers to a hypothetical future state where AI surpasses human intelligence in all areas. This concept is still highly debated among experts in the field.
