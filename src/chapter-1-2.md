Purpose of the Book
============================================

The purpose of this book is to provide a basic understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) for non-technical readers. AI is a complex and rapidly evolving field, and has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives and society. However, it can also be challenging for individuals without a technical background to understand the basics of AI, including its applications and impact.

In this book, we aim to demystify AI and provide an accessible introduction to this technology. The book will cover a range of topics related to AI, including its definition, different types of AI, their applications, as well as their ethical, social, and economic implications.

We believe that understanding AI is increasingly important in today's society, and that all individuals, regardless of their technical background, can benefit from learning about this topic. By providing a non-technical overview of AI, we hope to make this technology more approachable and help readers gain insights into the potential benefits and risks of AI.

Overall, our goal with this book is to equip non-technical readers with the knowledge and understanding needed to engage in conversations and make informed decisions related to AI. We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about AI, including students, business leaders, policymakers, and members of the general public.
